## What is it?

It is a 5 day customer-centric process for rapidly solving big challenges, creating new products, or improving existing ones. 

Design sprints enable you to:

* Clarify the problem at hand, and identify the needs of potential users
* Explore solutions through brainstorming and sketching exercises
* Distil your ideas into one or two solutions that you can test
* Prototype your solution and bring it to life
* Test the prototype with people who would use it

The process phases include: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype and Validate.

## Why use it?

The aim is to fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitment. It is a simple and cheap way to validate major assumptions, the Big question/s and point to the different options to explore further through delivery.

This set of practices reduces risks when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. Design Sprints are the fastest way to find out if a product or project is worth undertaking, if a feature is worth the effort, or if your value proposition is really valid. For the latter one should also consider running a [Research Sprint](https://library.gv.com/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions-97279b532b25). 

It compresses work into one week and importantly tests the design idea and provides real user feedback in rapid fashion.
